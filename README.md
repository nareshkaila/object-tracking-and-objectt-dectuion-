# object-tracking-and-objectt-detection-

This repository contains a Python script for practicing object detection using pre-trained models such as MobileNet SSD. The script loads an image, performs object detection using a deep learning model, and visualizes the results by drawing bounding boxes around detected objects. It is designed to help beginners understand and experiment with object detection tasks, leveraging powerful libraries like TensorFlow and OpenCV.

Features:
Pre-trained Object Detection Model: Uses a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model, fine-tuned on the COCO dataset, to detect common objects in an image.
Bounding Box Visualization: The script draws bounding boxes around detected objects and labels them according to the detected class.
OpenCV Integration: Uses OpenCV to display the processed image with detections and to handle image input/output.
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

TensorFlow 2.x: For loading and running the pre-trained object detection model.
OpenCV: For reading and displaying images.

###########
This repository demonstrates how to integrate object detection and object tracking using a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model with TensorFlow and OpenCV. The system first detects objects in a video using the object detection model and then tracks those objects across subsequent frames using OpenCV’s tracking algorithms.

Key Features:
Object Detection: Uses TensorFlow’s MobileNet SSD, a fast and efficient deep learning model, to detect common objects such as people, cars, and bicycles in real-time.
Object Tracking: After detecting an object, a tracker (e.g., TrackerCSRT) is initialized to track the object across subsequent video frames.
Real-Time Video Processing: The system continuously processes video frames and updates the object’s position, drawing bounding boxes around the tracked object.
Requirements
To run the project, you will need the following libraries:

TensorFlow 2.x: For object detection using a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model.
OpenCV: For image and video processing, including object tracking.

Future Improvements
Multiple Object Tracking: Integrate a tracking algorithm like DeepSORT for tracking multiple objects simultaneously.
Real-Time Video Processing: Enhance performance for real-time applications with optimization techniques.
Object Re-identification: Improve object persistence when objects leave and re-enter the frame.
